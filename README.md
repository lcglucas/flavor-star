# Welcome to the Flavor Star App

This project was built with Ruby on Rails for the backend and React for the frontend. The primary objective was to develop a robust, easily maintainable backend alongside a responsive and dynamic frontend based on the Single Page Application (SPA) architecture.

## Project Setup

In the project directory, you can run:

### `rails s`

After that, navigate to the client directory:

### `cd client`

Then run the following command to install frontend dependencies:

### `npm install`

Finally, start the frontend by running:

### `npm start`
